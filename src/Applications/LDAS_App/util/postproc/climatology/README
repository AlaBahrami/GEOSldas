The scripts in this directory are used to generate climatology data from GEOSldas output.

Specifically, the current set of scripts post-processes GEOSldas output into a soil moisture 
climatology nc4 file.  This file is needed as input by the SMAP L4SM ops system to compute soil 
moisture percentile output, i.e.,  "sm_rootzone_pctl"  and "sm_profile_pctl" for the L4SM 
"Geophysical" (gph) file collection. 

Generation of the soil moisture climatology nc4 file is done in two steps: 

1) Execute "Run_get_model_clim_stats.m" to compute and create pentad binary climatology files.
   (Separate files for "sm_rootzone" and "sm_profile".) 

2) Execute "Write_L4_sm_clim_stat_bin2nc4.m" to create the single L4 input netcdf file, *after* 
   all binary pentad files (73 for "sm_rootzone" + 73 for "sm_profile") are completed. 
   The .nc4 file is the only file needed in L4SM.

Note that the above jobs are memory intensive and typically take hours to run.  On Discover, it 
is necessary to use designated compute nodes.
